# Beyond Bets Project: Summary of Improvements and Rationale for Changes

## 1. Project Structure Reorganization

### Changes:

- the logic is contained in three main components:
  - **`base/`**: Contains the `BaseTransform` class, which serves as the foundation for all transformation logic.
  - **`datasets/`**: Contains the abstract classes and concrete implementations for accessing bets and market data.
  - **`transforms/`**: Contains specific transformation classes like `PlayerHourlyTransform`, `MarketDailyTransform`, `TopPlayersTransform`, and others.
- The main demonstration file is in `/examples/demo_v2.py`.
- Created a `/tests` directory for unit tests with a shared helper function for mock data generation in `/tests/conftest.py`.

### Rationale:
- This directory structure reflects a clean separation of concerns, adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**. Each directory focuses on a specific aspect of the system: transformations, data access, and shared logic (like the base transform).
- By moving the core logic into `src/`, we ensure that the project scales properly and can be installed or packaged as a Python module.
- The `examples/` directory is isolated for demonstration purposes, keeping example usage separate from the actual application logic.

## 2. Separation of Data Access Logic

### Changes:
- Created abstract classes for data fetching in `/datasets`:
  - **`BetsDataset`**: Abstract class for fetching bets data.
  - **`MarketDataset`**: Abstract class for fetching market data.
- Provided concrete implementations for data fetching:
  - **`FileBasedBetsDataset`**: Fetches bets data from files.
  - **`ApiBasedMarketDataset`**: Fetches market data from an API.

### Rationale:
- This approach adheres to the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**. The transformation logic depends on abstractions (`BetsDataset`, `MarketDataset`) instead of concrete implementations. This allows flexibility in changing data sources (e.g., files, APIs, databases) without modifying the core logic.
- Promotes code reusability and testability by allowing mock datasets to be injected during testing.

## 3. Refactored Transform Logic with BaseTransform

### Changes:
- Created a `BaseTransform` class in `/base/base_transform.py`, which is extended by all specific transformation classes (e.g., `PlayerHourlyTransform`, `MarketDailyTransform`, `TopPlayersTransform`, `BetGraderTransform`).
- Each transformation class implements its own logic in the `transform()` method.

### Rationale:
- This adheres to the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**, where the `BaseTransform` class is closed for modification but open for extension. New transformations can be added by extending the `BaseTransform` class without modifying the existing logic.
- Ensures that all transformations follow a common structure, making the code easier to understand and extend.

## 4. Unit Test Refactor with Centralized Mock Data Generation

### Changes:
- Centralized the mock data generation logic in `/tests/conftest.py` using a fixture.
- Updated all test cases to use the shared `generate_mock_data` fixture for creating deterministic datasets.
- Each transformation is unit tested in isolation, with the dataset fetching mocked.

### Rationale:
- Consolidating mock data generation promotes the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principle, reducing code duplication across test files.
- The use of `pytest` fixtures simplifies the test setup and provides a consistent and reusable way to generate test data.
- This improves test maintainability and makes it easier to modify or extend test logic.

---

## 5. Enhanced Code Readability and Maintainability

### Changes:
- Clearer naming conventions for classes and methods.
- Separation of logic into smaller, focused files.
- All transformation logic now resides in the `/transforms/` directory, with each transformation having its own dedicated file.

### Rationale:
- By keeping each transformation in its own file, we adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, making the code easier to read, maintain, and extend.
- Improved readability helps developers quickly locate relevant files and focus on specific functionality without dealing with monolithic code.

---

## 6. Scalability and Flexibility

### Changes:
- Data access is abstracted via interfaces, making it easy to switch between different data sources.
- The project structure allows for the addition of new transformations or data sources with minimal changes to the existing code.

### Rationale:
- These changes make the project highly flexible and scalable. For instance, switching from file-based data to a database or API can be achieved by implementing new concrete classes without affecting the transformation logic.
- The project is now set up for easy integration of future enhancements, ensuring scalability in terms of features, data volume, and sources.

---

## Conclusion:

The refactoring efforts have resulted in a more maintainable, scalable, and flexible codebase. By adhering to **SOLID** principles, the project now has:
- Clear separation of concerns between data access and transformation logic.
- Easily extendable transformation classes through inheritance.
- Improved testability with centralized mock data generation and isolated unit tests.
- A more organized directory structure that separates core logic from examples and tests, making the project easier to understand, scale, and maintain over time.

## Misc/Todo:

- Implement Make [all,install, lint, format, test]
- Conform to PEP, flake8, black, security standards

### Changes in Business Logic
1. **Refinement of Aggregations**: Altered business logic to refine how aggregations are handled within transformations. For example, clarified definitions for `market_value` and `bet_amount` to differentiate them accurately in the context of bets vs. market aggregations.
2. **Data Windowing for Temporal Accuracy**: Applied explicit `window` functions for daily and hourly summaries, ensuring that time-based data like `player_hourly` and `market_daily` accurately reflect real-time windows.
3. **Unified Data Join Logic**: Centralized data joins to reduce redundancy and ensure consistent business rules for linking `player`, `market`, and `bets` data across transformations.

### Changes to Transformation Interfaces/Usage
1. **Abstract Transformation Class**: Introduced an abstract `BaseTransform` class, standardizing `transform()` methods across various transformations like `PlayerMarketDailyTransform` and `MarketDailyTransform`.
2. **Simplified Initialization**: Reduced transformation initialization arguments by standardizing `DataAccess` instances, improving reusability and reducing dependencies.
3. **Flexible Window Parameterization**: Added parameterized window durations (e.g., "1 day", "1 hour") in the transformations, making them more adaptable to varying business requirements.

### API Method that Doesnâ€™t Utilize an API
1. **Refactor of API-Based Market Dataset**: The `ApiBasedMarketDataset` was modified to fetch data from generated mock data instead of an API. This class could be renamed or refactored to clarify that it relies on local data rather than an actual API call.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Suggested a clear separation in naming and structure between `API-based` and `File-based` or `Mock-based` datasets, ensuring the API interface accurately reflects its data source.

### Data Modeling
1. **Schema Consistency**: Defined consistent data schemas across `BetsDataset` and `MarketDataset`, using structured field names like `market_value`, `total_bets`, and `average_odds` to standardize terminology and ensure clarity in downstream aggregations.
2. **Temporal Data Separation**: Separated timestamp columns (e.g., `timestamp`, `market_timestamp`) to avoid ambiguity, particularly in joined datasets.
3. **Normalized Data Aggregation**: Modeled transformations to produce normalized results for `player_id` and `market_id`, supporting clearer downstream analysis and visualizations.

### Further Improvements
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Integrate custom error handling around transformations, especially in `fetch_*` methods, to catch and log any unexpected data issues.
2. **Efficiency Enhancements**: Experiment with caching frequently used datasets in transformations, such as `market_data` and `bets_data`, to reduce re-computation costs across transformations.
3. **Automated Data Validation**: Consider adding validation methods to transformations to ensure data quality at each stage (e.g., checking row counts or expected column types).

### Show Statements Inside Transforms
1. **Production Logging in Place of `.show()`**: In production, replace `.show()` statements with logging summaries or statistics (e.g., row counts, min/max values) to ensure visibility while minimizing performance impacts.
2. **Sample-based Data Audit**: Capture sample data periodically from within transformations (e.g., `sample(0.1)`) for auditing rather than displaying large datasets, storing results in a secure location for troubleshooting if needed.
3. **Conditional `.show()` for Non-Production Environments**: Wrap `.show()` calls with environment-based conditions to prevent execution in production, while enabling data visibility in development or testing.
