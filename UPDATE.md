# Beyond Bets Project: Summary of Improvements and Rationale for Changes

## 1. Project Structure Reorganization

### Changes:

- the logic is contained in three main components:
  - **`base/`**: Contains the `BaseTransform` class, which serves as the foundation for all transformation logic.
  - **`datasets/`**: Contains the abstract classes and concrete implementations for accessing bets and market data.
  - **`transforms/`**: Contains specific transformation classes like `PlayerHourlyTransform`, `MarketDailyTransform`, `TopPlayersTransform`, and others.
- The main demonstration file is in `/examples/demo_v2.py`.
- Created a `/tests` directory for unit tests with a shared helper function for mock data generation in `/tests/conftest.py`.

### Rationale:
- This directory structure reflects a clean separation of concerns, adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**. Each directory focuses on a specific aspect of the system: transformations, data access, and shared logic (like the base transform).
- By moving the core logic into `src/`, we ensure that the project scales properly and can be installed or packaged as a Python module.
- The `examples/` directory is isolated for demonstration purposes, keeping example usage separate from the actual application logic.

## 2. Separation of Data Access Logic

### Changes:
- Created abstract classes for data fetching in `/datasets`:
  - **`BetsDataset`**: Abstract class for fetching bets data.
  - **`MarketDataset`**: Abstract class for fetching market data.
- Provided concrete implementations for data fetching:
  - **`FileBasedBetsDataset`**: Fetches bets data from files.
  - **`ApiBasedMarketDataset`**: Fetches market data from an API.

### Rationale:
- This approach adheres to the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**. The transformation logic depends on abstractions (`BetsDataset`, `MarketDataset`) instead of concrete implementations. This allows flexibility in changing data sources (e.g., files, APIs, databases) without modifying the core logic.
- Promotes code reusability and testability by allowing mock datasets to be injected during testing.

## 3. Refactored Transform Logic with BaseTransform

### Changes:
- Created a `BaseTransform` class in `/base/base_transform.py`, which is extended by all specific transformation classes (e.g., `PlayerHourlyTransform`, `MarketDailyTransform`, `TopPlayersTransform`, `BetGraderTransform`).
- Each transformation class implements its own logic in the `transform()` method.

### Rationale:
- This adheres to the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**, where the `BaseTransform` class is closed for modification but open for extension. New transformations can be added by extending the `BaseTransform` class without modifying the existing logic.
- Ensures that all transformations follow a common structure, making the code easier to understand and extend.

## 4. Unit Test Refactor with Centralized Mock Data Generation

### Changes:
- Centralized the mock data generation logic in `/tests/conftest.py` using a fixture.
- Updated all test cases to use the shared `generate_mock_data` fixture for creating deterministic datasets.
- Each transformation is unit tested in isolation, with the dataset fetching mocked.

### Rationale:
- Consolidating mock data generation promotes the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principle, reducing code duplication across test files.
- The use of `pytest` fixtures simplifies the test setup and provides a consistent and reusable way to generate test data.
- This improves test maintainability and makes it easier to modify or extend test logic.

## 5. Enhanced Code Readability and Maintainability

### Changes:
- Clearer naming conventions for classes and methods.
- Separation of logic into smaller, focused files.
- All transformation logic now resides in the `/transforms/` directory, with each transformation having its own dedicated file.

### Rationale:
- By keeping each transformation in its own file, we adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, making the code easier to read, maintain, and extend.
- Improved readability helps developers quickly locate relevant files and focus on specific functionality without dealing with monolithic code.

---

## 6. Scalability and Flexibility

### Changes:
- Data access is abstracted via interfaces, making it easy to switch between different data sources.
- The project structure allows for the addition of new transformations or data sources with minimal changes to the existing code.

### Rationale:
- These changes make the project highly flexible and scalable. For instance, switching from file-based data to a database or API can be achieved by implementing new concrete classes without affecting the transformation logic.
- The project is now set up for easy integration of future enhancements, ensuring scalability in terms of features, data volume, and sources.

---

## Conclusion:

The refactoring efforts have resulted in a more maintainable, scalable, and flexible codebase. By adhering to **SOLID** principles, the project now has:
- Clear separation of concerns between data access and transformation logic.
- Easily extendable transformation classes through inheritance.
- Improved testability with centralized mock data generation and isolated unit tests.
- A more organized directory structure that separates core logic from examples and tests, making the project easier to understand, scale, and maintain over time.

## Todo:

- Implement Make [all,install, lint, format, test]
- Conform to PEP, flake8, black, security standards
